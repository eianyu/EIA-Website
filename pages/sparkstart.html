				SparkStart as NYU&#39;s leading student startup lab run by students is here to support all stages of student
				entrepreneurs and startups. All you need to apply is a viable idea. The program has partnered with
				some of the leading tech companies, startups, founders, and industry players to help provide
				accepted startups and entrepreneurs in the program with great value and support.

				As a year long program, the first stage is focused on idea validation, building a prototype, and using
				the Lean startup methodology to better iterate and pivot if needed. Teams will also learn to pitch and
				better execute with the help of mentors. The first stage of the program will conclude with a showcase
				displaying the growth and improvements of each team over the past few months. The second stage of
				the program is highly focused on really reaching product market fit, fleshing out the business model
				and plan of each team, and scaling. Throughout the entire program, teams will be advised by EIA
				partners and will meet weekly with EIA partners for a weekly standup. The standup is a key part of the
				program as it helps keep each team focused, motivated, updated, and allows EIA partners to suggest
				possible resources available to solve blocks. The program will finally conclude with a Demo Day,
				allowing each team to showcase their final product and raise capital if appropriate. SparkStart teams
				are highly encouraged to apply for the InnoVention competition and priority will be given to top
				SparkStart teams.
